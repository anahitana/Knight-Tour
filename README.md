# Knight-Tour
A Knight's Tour is a sequence of moves by a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

The knight moves in a particular way. For the first move the user can select any square. When the player clicks on a square, the square is highlighted in the colour yellow and the number of moves made so far is shown
The next move must be to a valid move to another square. When that move is made it is shown in yellow, the previous move is shown in blue.
